* The flag on the dish holder arm is a supressed feature in "dishHolderArm.ipt", unsupress Extrusion2 to load the feature

* Many variable parts are made by directly editing extrusion distance, including:
- the thickness of the dishHolderBase, which is determined by Extrusion6
- the length of the dishholderArm, which is determined by Extrusion1
